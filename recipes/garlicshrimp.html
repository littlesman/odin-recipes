    <p>If you like sushi, sashimi, ceviche, or fish crudo, or even if you just like beautiful, delicious, easy things to make, this garlic shrimp aguachile is for you. Aguachile, or “chile water,” uses lime juice to “cook” the shrimp, or, if served immediately, to just make the shrimp taste fabulous. And you are going to serve it on tortilla chips, so if you weren't tempted already, now you certainly are.</p>
